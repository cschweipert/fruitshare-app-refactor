This project was inpired by bears. I live in a small mountain town in the foothills of the San Juans in Colorado. 
We love our bears and want to keep them safe. If we don't have time to pick our fruit, the bears will come to town to 
pick it for us. That's not safe for bears or humans. The idea of this project is that fruit tree owners can put their 
trees on a map for others to see so they can get help to pick the fruit. Everybear wins. If the user clicks on the points, 
a popup will inform her about the type of fruit and location.
This app was built with ❤︎ and the help of Node Express, EJS, MongoDB and the Esri JavaScript API.
